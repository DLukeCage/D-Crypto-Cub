  <h2>Some information on the history of crypto currewncy</h2>
  <p> Modern cryptocurrencies were first mentioned in 1988. The concept fully emerged in 2009 with the release of a white paper that explains the foundations of blockchain and bitcoin. The author of the white paper is “Satoshi Nakamoto,” which is presumably a pseudonym for either a person or group of people.</p>

<h3> BlockChain </h3>
<p>"According to IBM, "Blockchain defined: Blockchain is a shared, immutable ledger that facilitates the process of recording transactions and tracking assets in a business network. An asset can be tangible (a house, car, cash, land) or intangible (intellectual property, patents, copyrights, branding). Virtually anything of value can be tracked and traded on a blockchain network, reducing risk and cutting costs for all involved"<a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/what-is-blockchain">BLOCKCHAIN</a></p>
  <p>Here is a link to a YouTube video explaining Blockchain technology that you will find helpful.  It is a 2-hour course so watch when you have enough time set aside!!<a href="https://youtu.be/qOVAbKKSH10">Blockchain Course</a></p>
