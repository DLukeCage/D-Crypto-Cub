<h2>A few helpful suggestions to guide you through the Crypto matrix!!</h2>
<section>
<h3> Exchanges </h3>
<p>There are many crypto exchanges to choose from. Some are often not in the US available, so be sure to find out which exchange is open I your region.  Also, some exchanges are not available in a particular area but can be legally accessed when using a VPN(will discuss VPN in the security section). It is also a good idea to have multi exchanges, especially during a bull run.  Some exchanges can be overwhelmed during this cycle and temporarily down due to the massive surge of customer volumeâ€”That why it is a good idea to have multiple exchanges. Plus, you might not find all of the coins listed on one exchange, so you will need another to purchase them.</p>

<h3>Security</h3>  
<p>Security should always be your number one priority when investing and dealing with cryptocurrencies.  You must take steps to fully secure and maintain a high-security level in the crypto world.  Always make sure to update your software, keep back-ups in a safe location.  Never give anyone your security codes or passwords; use 2-step verification when applicable.  Never trust a non-secure connection;<a href="https://youtu.be/2z2xggmeW1A">SECURITY</a></p>

<h3>Classes</h3> 
<p>There are some tremendous academy courses from some top respected crypto knowledge people.  These classes are great for beginners to learn the terminology, skills, and technical analysis to help anyone become a veteran in this space.  Some of the courses just offer the basics to start your journey. Some go more into details, and some even teach you job skills to become a person in the new trending blockchain workforce.  Here are just two that I think are fundamentally sound, not too pricey to teach you the wanted skills you crave to learn about crypto. The first is an excellent course in the technical analysis of crypto. This course will teach you the fundamentals of chart analysis and how to do some leveraged trading;<a href="https://bitcoinacademy.teachable.com/">BITCOIN ACADEMY</a></p>
<p>The last choice that I recommend is for beginners, as well as intermediate level consumers.  Ivan academy offers the essential, as well as development for people who are interested in working in the Crypto market;<a href="https://academy.ivanontech.com/">IVAN ACADEMY</a></p>
