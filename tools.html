<h2>The Items you will need to Succeed in Crypto!!!</h2>
<section>
<h3> Exchanges </h3>
<p>All of the following choices are US-based exchanges.  The first one is the best one for beginners and is also the top worldwide used exchange, with its user-friendly UI and tools on its website; that's why my top choice for beginners is;<a href="https://www.coinbase.com/">COINBASE</a></p>
	<p>The second exchange I will recommend it for the intermediate crypto user.  This exchange is for the user who is getting more comfortable with cryptocurrency and wants to dive deeper into the ecosystem and invest in different altcoins that coinbase doesn't offer.  This exchange has two other exchanges, a US-based and a global one; the one I recommend is the US-based one called;<a href="https://www.binance.us/en/home">BINANCE.US</a></p>
	<p>The last exchange that I recommend is an alternative one or another business to add.  You should have more than one option, especially in a bull market(I will explain that in the skills section). This exchange offer customization, security, and good navigation on its website;<a href="https://www.gemini.com/">GEMINI</a></p>

<h3>Hardware wallets</h3>  
<p>I will go further into detail on what precisely a hardware wallet is. Still, I will recommend here two that I considered worth your trust and money!!  The first one and is the one I use regularly is this one;<a href="https://www.ellipal.com/">ELLIPAL</a>  This wallet is easy to use and works on all platforms, ios, Android, Windows and MAC OS.</p>
<p>The second wallet, which is a common and most used cold wallet in the crypto universe is the;<a href="https://www.ledger.com/">LEDGER</a> I would personally go with the ledger nano X.  It has a bigger screen which makes it easer to read and operate the buttons on the device </p>

<h3>Examples</h3> 
<p>When I first started into cryptocurrency, I researched online and read books on the subject.  I watch tons of youtube videos to help me understand it all. Still, I found this particular one to be the best beginners video on what you will need to get your journey into crypto going without a great deal of confusion. More critical letting you know what you need to make your crypto run a safe and secure one.<a href="https://youtu.be/sEtj34VMClU">BEGINNERS GUIDE</a> This video will take you step by step on what you will need to make that first purchase of a crypto coin!!</p>
